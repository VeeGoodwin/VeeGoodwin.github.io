        <h1> San Francisco: The Best and Worst </h1>
        
        <h2>The Best: Wilsborough</h2>
        <p>
            Wilsborough is the best neighborhood because along the sidewalks next to the houses everyone stands and waves. Each house is made beautifully to copy the older style architecture, in light pastel colors. There's a unicorn farm in the center of the beighborhood, with foals that you can feed and pet. Every house has a pool, and every pool has its own pool, and even the <em>unicorns</em> have their own pool! Now isn't that just the best?
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Worst: Scantanvil</h2>
        <p>
            As for the worst neighborhoods Scantanvil is lined with metal houses all looking the same. The houses have no windows, and only one door.People are never seen outside, and when they are they never smile. <strong>NO</strong> birds can be heard singing, no animals frolicking, and no general happiness to be found. The worst part about this neighborhood is that it's the most affordable.
