        <p4> Here comes Yuki again! This time he’s harassing me as I try to draw. To be honest, he normally doesn’t do this at all he always plays with his mice toys or chases my other cat around. I thought it would be a fun and playful idea to try out, even if this isn't his normal personality!</p4>
