        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Viana Goodwin, and this simple website is to give you some examples of some artworks I've done in my design class. As a little about me, I am a very friendly person, and very sociable, but also kind of shy. I love to draw, and I love to try new things. Like this website! Never done one before! Feel free to explore my works, and click on the contact link below if you want to see more of the things I've done!</p>
