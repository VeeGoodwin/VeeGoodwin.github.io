        <p3>This project was to lay out a set of postcards to show the artworks I did up to that point in the semester. Out of everything, this was clearly my least favorite project. InDesign has always been complicated for me so this entire thing was a struggle. Honestly it could have been worse right? Just take a scroll on through and look at my pieces!
