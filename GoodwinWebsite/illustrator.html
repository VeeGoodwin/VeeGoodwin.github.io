        <p>For this project my little baby boy Yuki was my inspiration. I stalked him for a month at a shelter, and just knew that he was the one...love at first sight if you will. I’m so in love with him! But he is a little devil monster, biting things he shouldn’t, jumping on things he shouldn’t, etc. So I wanted to capture his chaotic energy into this picture.</p>
