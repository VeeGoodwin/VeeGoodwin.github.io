\f0\i\fs28 \cf0 For this photoshop final I chose video games as my inspiration. During this semester of school I\'92ve been taking on four full classes as well as working part-time. The image is supposed to represent how you\'92re able to use video games as a means for escape from all the stress and work. The characters all along the background are from video gamesI love or really want to play.\
