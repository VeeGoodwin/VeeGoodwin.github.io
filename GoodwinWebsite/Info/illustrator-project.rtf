\f0\i\fs28 \cf0 For this project my little baby boy Yuki was my inspiration. I stalked him for a month at the shelter, and I\'92m so in love with him. But he is a little devil monster, biting things he shouldn\'92t, jumping on things he shouldn\'92t, etc. So I wanted to capture his energy into this picture. \
