        <p>This photoshop project required that we place ourselves into the piece somehow. I chose videogames as my inspiration for this one. During the semester of school I've been taking on four full classes as well as working part-time. The image is supposed to represent how you're able to use videogames as a means for escape from all the stress and work load. The characters all along the background are from videogames I love or really want to play.</p>
